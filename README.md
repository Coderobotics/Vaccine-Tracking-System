# Vaccine-Tracking-System
Employee Vaccination Tracking Software can help to easily retrieve the individuals’ covid vaccination records. It generates printable details and records of each individual. Immunization Tracking Software can be accessed by 2 types of users which are the Admin Users and the Staff Users. The Admin Users can access and manage all the pages and functionalities of the system including the list of system users and system information management. The Staff Users can only manage vaccination records/history of the individuals which have been vaccinated on their area/vaccination center allocation. They can also manage the individual’s list and print their record.
